This documents the baseline design of the SO:UK Data Centre at [Blackett](https://www.blackett.manchester.ac.uk).

The GitHub repository [simonsobs-uk/data-centre](https://github.com/simonsobs-uk/data-centre) contains

- source of the documentation, including the codes in the documentation that you can run directly,
- the Issues tracker as well as Discussions, for any data centre related bugs or questions, and
- a Python package for data centre maintenance.

To access our documentation, you have a few options, (in the order of convenience to advanced usages):

1. [SO:UK Data Centre documentation at Read the Docs](https://souk-data-centre.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This gives you access to all versions of SO:UK Data Centre documentations, as well as multiple output formats including HTML, ePub, PDF.
2. [SO:UK Data Centre documentation at GitHub Pages](https://simonsobs-uk.github.io/data-centre/) which is HTML only and points to the latest commits only.
3. [SO:UK Data Centre documentation at GitHub Releases](https://github.com/simonsobs-uk/data-centre/releases/latest). This gives you additional output formats such as man page and plain text.

Note that [Read the Docs serves the searches from server-side powered by Elasticsearch](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/server-side-search/index.html). So searches from Read the Docs and GitHub Pages will gives you different results. Try the Read the Docs first for better results and fall back to GitHub Pages.
