## New accounts

### New SO:UK VO membership

Go to [VOMS Admin > souk.ac.uk](https://voms.gridpp.ac.uk:8443/voms/souk.ac.uk/admin/home.action) and manage there. 

(new-users)=
### Adding new users on the submit node `vm77`

Point the user to [this section](#obtaining-unix-account) and ask them to send those info to you.

0. If the user ssh key comment contains their email address,
    replace it with something else.
1. Edit `/usr/local/etc/staged/common.yaml` on `vm77`, replace the following `ALL_CAP` variables accordingly,

    ```yaml
    common::users:
      USER_NAME:
        uid: UID
        comment: FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME
        home: /home/USER_NAME
        keys:
          - "ssh-ed25519 KEY_VALUE COMMENT"
        password: "$6$...$..."
        groups:
          - sudo
          - simonsobservatory
    ```

    :::{note}
    For `UID`, increments according to the list. Just make sure it has not been used.

    For `sudo` groups, obviously only grant those you want them to have sudo privillege.
    :::

2. Tell Robert to update.

3. To check if the config is populated, check the file `/etc/passwd` and see if the new users is there. If it does, the user should be ready to go.

:::{warning}
The content of this file contains sensitive information,
such as salted, hashed passwords,
which is configured to be readable only to `root` at `/etc/shadow`.
Hence, the config file `/usr/local/etc/staged/common.yaml` should be treated
with the same level of permission.

## Software deployments

(CVMFS-pub)=
### Publishing to CVMFS

See [above](#content-manager-registration) if you haven't applied for the role of content manager yet.

Then

```sh
ssh northgridsgm@cvmfs-upload01.gridpp.rl.ac.uk
```

Then starts to write something in `~/cvmfs_repo/simonsobservatory`. What you write will immediately be available at `/cvmfs/northgrid.gridpp.ac.uk/simonsobservatory` on this publishing node. But it will only be synchronized to other sites with a time scale of around 2.5-3 hours.

On `vm77`, check if you see your stuffs is in `/cvmfs/northgrid.gridpp.ac.uk/simonsobservatory` already, if so, you can start to submit jobs that reads from there.
