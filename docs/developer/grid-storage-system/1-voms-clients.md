To authenticate your machine to the grid, you need to

```sh
# Arch Linux from AUR using yay
yay -S gct
```

Requesting a host certificate for your machine, go to <https://portal.ca.grid-support.ac.uk/cert_owner/requestHostCert>.

If you work on machines supported by us, you can skip this part. This part needed to be done once per machine.

## Installing the clients

You would need to install VOMS Clients by following the instruction in the [VOMS Clients guide](https://italiangrid.github.io/voms/documentation/voms-clients-guide/3.0.5/#installing-the-clients-). The currently supported OS is either RHEL 6/7 or Debian 6 as of writing:

```sh
# RHEL
sudo yum install voms-clients-java
# Debian
sudo apt-get install voms-clients3
# Arch Linux from AUR using yay
yay -S voms-clients
```

## Configuring VOMS trust anchors

Create these paths with the corresponding contents below:

```console
# generated by running
$ head /etc/grid-security/vomsdir/souk.ac.uk/*
==> /etc/grid-security/vomsdir/souk.ac.uk/voms02.gridpp.ac.uk.lsc <==
/C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Oxford/L=OeSC/CN=voms02.gridpp.ac.uk
/C=UK/O=eScienceCA/OU=Authority/CN=UK e-Science CA 2B

==> /etc/grid-security/vomsdir/souk.ac.uk/voms03.gridpp.ac.uk.lsc <==
/C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Imperial/L=Physics/CN=voms03.gridpp.ac.uk
/C=UK/O=eScienceCA/OU=Authority/CN=UK e-Science CA 2B

==> /etc/grid-security/vomsdir/souk.ac.uk/voms.gridpp.ac.uk.lsc <==
/C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Manchester/L=HEP/CN=voms.gridpp.ac.uk
/C=UK/O=eScienceCA/OU=Authority/CN=UK e-Science CA 2B
```

## Configuring VOMS server endpoints

Create these paths with the corresponding contents below:

```console
# generated by running
$ head /etc/vomses/* 
==> /etc/vomses/souk.ac.uk-voms02.gridpp.ac.uk <==
"souk.ac.uk" "voms02.gridpp.ac.uk" "15519" "/C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Oxford/L=OeSC/CN=voms02.gridpp.ac.uk" "souk.ac.uk" "24"

==> /etc/vomses/souk.ac.uk-voms03.gridpp.ac.uk <==
"souk.ac.uk" "voms03.gridpp.ac.uk" "15519" "/C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Imperial/L=Physics/CN=voms03.gridpp.ac.uk" "souk.ac.uk" "24"

==> /etc/vomses/souk.ac.uk-voms.gridpp.ac.uk <==
"souk.ac.uk" "voms.gridpp.ac.uk" "15519" "/C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Manchester/L=HEP/CN=voms.gridpp.ac.uk" "souk.ac.uk" "24"
