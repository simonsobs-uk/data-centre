# Quick start

As a quick start to go right into the current recommended way to run an MPI job, go through

1. The table in the beginning of the [User guide](#user) if you are a NERSC user,
2. [Running pipelines](#running-pipelines) to have an overview,
3. [OpenMPI](#OpenMPI) for the current recommended way to start an MPI job,
4. [Transfer output files](#0-transfer-output-files) to see how to copy files back from worker nodes to submit node.

Optionally, go to [Interactive job](#1-classad-interactive) for starting interactive job.
