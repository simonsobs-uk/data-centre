# Writing ClassAdâ€”vanilla universe

To request a job in the vanilla universe, create a file `example.ini`,

```{literalinclude} 12-classad-vanilla/example.ini
:language: ini
```

And then submit your job using

```bash
condor_submit example.ini; tail -F hello_world.log hello_world.out hello_world.err
```

The `tail` will shows you the status of your job in real time.

## Explanation

`executable = /bin/echo`
: **Purpose**: Defines the program or script to be executed.
: **Explanation**: The job will run the `echo` command, which is typically located in the `/bin/` directory.

`arguments = "hello world"`
: **Purpose**: Provides the arguments to be passed to the `executable`.
: **Explanation**: The `echo` command will be invoked with the argument "hello world", causing it to print this string.

`output = hello_world.out`
: **Purpose**: Specifies the file to capture the standard output of the job.
: **Explanation**: Any output produced by the `echo` command (in this case, "hello world") will be written to a file named `hello_world.out` in the job's submission directory.

`error = hello_world.err`
: **Purpose**: Specifies the file to capture the standard error of the job.
: **Explanation**: If the `echo` command produces any error messages, they will be written to this file. For this simple example, it's unlikely there will be any errors.

`log = hello_world.log`
: **Purpose**: Designates the file where HTCondor will write log messages related to the job's execution.
: **Explanation**: This file will contain logs about the job's lifecycle, such as when it was started, if it was evicted, and when it completed.

`stream_output = True`
: **Purpose**: Determines if the standard output should be streamed to the output file in real-time.
: **Explanation**: By setting this to `True`, the `hello_world.out` file will be updated in real-time as the job produces output. This can be useful for monitoring long-running jobs.

`stream_error = True`
: **Purpose**: Determines if the standard error should be streamed to the error file in real-time.
: **Explanation**: Similar to `stream_output`, this ensures that the `hello_world.err` file is updated in real-time if the job produces any error messages.

`queue`
: **Purpose**: This command tells HTCondor to add the job to its queue.
: **Explanation**: Once this ClassAd is submitted using the `condor_submit` command, HTCondor will schedule the job to run on a suitable machine in its pool.
