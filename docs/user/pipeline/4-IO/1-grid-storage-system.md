# Setting up access to the grid storage system

You will need to

1. Setup VOMS clients using your grid certificate for authentications, and
2. uses the gfal tools to access the grid storage system.

## Setting up VOMS Clients

If you work on machines supported by us, you can skip this part. This part needed to be done once per machine.

### Installing the clients

You would need to install VOMS Clients by following the instruction in the [VOMS Clients guide](https://italiangrid.github.io/voms/documentation/voms-clients-guide/3.0.5/#installing-the-clients-). The currently supported OS is either RHEL 6/7 or Debian 6 as of writing:

```bash
# RHEL
sudo yum install voms-clients-java
# Debian
sudo apt-get install voms-clients3
```

### Configuring VOMS trust anchors

Create these paths with the corresponding contents below:

```sh
# generated by running
# head /etc/grid-security/vomsdir/souk.ac.uk/*
==> /etc/grid-security/vomsdir/souk.ac.uk/voms02.gridpp.ac.uk.lsc <==
/C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Oxford/L=OeSC/CN=voms02.gridpp.ac.uk
/C=UK/O=eScienceCA/OU=Authority/CN=UK e-Science CA 2B

==> /etc/grid-security/vomsdir/souk.ac.uk/voms03.gridpp.ac.uk.lsc <==
/C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Imperial/L=Physics/CN=voms03.gridpp.ac.uk
/C=UK/O=eScienceCA/OU=Authority/CN=UK e-Science CA 2B

==> /etc/grid-security/vomsdir/souk.ac.uk/voms.gridpp.ac.uk.lsc <==
/C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Manchester/L=HEP/CN=voms.gridpp.ac.uk
/C=UK/O=eScienceCA/OU=Authority/CN=UK e-Science CA 2B
```

### Configuring VOMS server endpoints

Create these paths with the corresponding contents below:

```sh
# generated by running
# head /etc/vomses/* 
==> /etc/vomses/souk.ac.uk-voms02.gridpp.ac.uk <==
"souk.ac.uk" "voms02.gridpp.ac.uk" "15519" "/C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Oxford/L=OeSC/CN=voms02.gridpp.ac.uk" "souk.ac.uk" "24"

==> /etc/vomses/souk.ac.uk-voms03.gridpp.ac.uk <==
"souk.ac.uk" "voms03.gridpp.ac.uk" "15519" "/C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Imperial/L=Physics/CN=voms03.gridpp.ac.uk" "souk.ac.uk" "24"

==> /etc/vomses/souk.ac.uk-voms.gridpp.ac.uk <==
"souk.ac.uk" "voms.gridpp.ac.uk" "15519" "/C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Manchester/L=HEP/CN=voms.gridpp.ac.uk" "souk.ac.uk" "24"
```

(user-credentials)=
## User credentials

This part needed to be done once per machine.

You need to have your grid certificate `certBundle.p12` ready that you obtained from [this section](#obtaining-grid-cert). Then run

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.globus/"
mv certBundle.p12 "$HOME/.globus/usercred.p12"
chmod 600 "$HOME/.globus/usercred.p12"
```

(creating-a-proxy)=
## Creating a proxy

This part needed to be done periodically.

```bash
voms-proxy-init --voms souk.ac.uk --valid 168:0
```

> The command `voms-proxy-init` is used to contact the VOMS server and retrieve an Attribute Certificate (AC) containing user attributes that will be included in the proxy certificates.

The Attribute Certificate (AC) is configured with a maximum validity of 168 hours (7 days).

Example output after running this command will be:

```
❯ voms-proxy-init --voms souk.ac.uk --valid 168:0
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
Contacting voms03.gridpp.ac.uk:15519 [/C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Imperial/L=Physics/CN=voms03.gridpp.ac.uk] "souk.ac.uk"...
Remote VOMS server contacted succesfully.


Created proxy in /tmp/x509up_u$UID.

Your proxy is valid until Tue Nov 14 08:45:38 GMT 2023
```

The path `/tmp/x509up_u$UID` will be useful later. You can also run `voms-proxy-info --all` and see it again in the `path` attributes.

## Accessing the grid storage system

You can now access our grid storage system at

- <davs://bohr3226.tier2.hep.manchester.ac.uk:443//dpm/tier2.hep.manchester.ac.uk/home/souk.ac.uk/>, or
- <root://bohr3226.tier2.hep.manchester.ac.uk:1094//dpm/tier2.hep.manchester.ac.uk/home/souk.ac.uk/>.

:::{warning}
Notice the double slash in `...ac.uk:...//dpm/...`. If a single slash is used, some tools might fail.
:::

For example, to see what's inside,

```bash
gfal-ls -alH --full-time davs://bohr3226.tier2.hep.manchester.ac.uk//dpm/tier2.hep.manchester.ac.uk/home/souk.ac.uk/
# or
gfal-ls -alH --full-time root://bohr3226.tier2.hep.manchester.ac.uk//dpm/tier2.hep.manchester.ac.uk/home/souk.ac.uk/
```

And to make a directory there,

```bash
gfal-mkdir davs://bohr3226.tier2.hep.manchester.ac.uk//dpm/tier2.hep.manchester.ac.uk/home/souk.ac.uk/testing
# or
gfal-mkdir root://bohr3226.tier2.hep.manchester.ac.uk//dpm/tier2.hep.manchester.ac.uk/home/souk.ac.uk/testing
```

To delete it,

```bash
gfal-rm -r davs://bohr3226.tier2.hep.manchester.ac.uk//dpm/tier2.hep.manchester.ac.uk/home/souk.ac.uk/testing
# or
gfal-rm -r root://bohr3226.tier2.hep.manchester.ac.uk//dpm/tier2.hep.manchester.ac.uk/home/souk.ac.uk/testing
```

:::{note}
We omitted the port when gfal is used here, as the default ports are used.
:::

:::{warning}
You can delete files created by others, vice versa. Thing twice before deleting or overwriting. To protect your files, you may use gfal-chmod below.

(gfal)=
