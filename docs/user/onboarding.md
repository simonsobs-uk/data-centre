# Onboarding

You will need to

1. have a grid certificate,
2. register to a VO,
3. and obtain a UNIX account.

## Grid certificate

Go to [UK Certification Authority Portal](https://portal.ca.grid-support.ac.uk/) and obtain a grid certificate.

:::{note}
You may need to use a different website if you are outside UK. TODO: add other countries' links here.

Follow the instruction over there to obtain grid certificate. They implements a strong principle of [Web of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust) and requires you to physically verify your identity in-person with an existing member of the Grid.

## Registering the SO:UK Virtual Organization (VO) and obtain a grid certificate

Go to [VOMS Admin > souk.ac.uk](https://voms.gridpp.ac.uk:8443/voms/souk.ac.uk/register/start.action) and submit an application to the VO.

:::{note}
They prefer you to use your institutional email here. It does not have to match your email address used in the Grid Certificate.

Once submitted, you will receive an email. Once you clicked the link in the email to confirm your application, you need to wait for admin to process it.

Occasionally the application went into a blackhole, feel free to ping the admin there or us if you aren't approved in a couple of days.
